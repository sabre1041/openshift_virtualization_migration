## Requirements

The following Ansible Collections are required:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: redhat.openshift_virtualization
  - name: redhat.openshift
  - name: vmware.vmware_rest
  - name: ansible.posix
  - name: infra.aap_utilities
  - name: kubernetes.core
  - name: community.crypto
  - name: community.general
  - name: community.vmware

  # AAP <=2.4
  - name: infra.controller_configuration
  - name: ansible.controller
    version: "<=4.5.12"

  # AAP 2.5+
  - name: ansible.platform
  - name: ansible.controller
  - name: infra.aap_configuration
...
```

## Installation

You can install the `infra.openshift_virtualization_migration` collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install infra.openshift_virtualization_migration
```

Note that if you install any collections from Ansible Galaxy, they will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the Ansible package.

To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install infra.openshift_virtualization_migration --upgrade
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: infra.openshift_virtualization_migration
    # If you need a specific version of the collection, you can specify like this:
    # version: ...
...
```

See
[Using Ansible Collections](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/latest/collections_guide/index.html)
for more details.

## Use Cases

This collection is ideal for accomplishing the following using Ansible automation:

* Analyzing existing Virtual Machine hypervisor environments.
* Installing and configuring Ansible Automation Platform.
* Preparing OpenShift environments to support Virtual Machines and migrating Virtual Machines from existing hypervisors using the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV).
* Migrating Virtual Machines using the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV).

## Testing

[tox](https://tox.wiki) is used to perform tests and verification of this collection.

The following commands can be used to execute the various types of tests implemented:

```shell
tox -av # lists all tests

tox # run them all

tox -e <test name> # run specific one

tox -f sanity --ansible -c tox-ansible.ini     # run tox-ansible that does our ansible-test sanity suite
```
